## 🔥 Overview

We propose MLLM-Driven Synthetic Multimodal (**MDSM**), a large scale,  semantic-aligned multi-modal benchmark with  high-fidelity texts from MLLM, supporting fake news detecting and grounding tasks.

And an Artifact-aware Manipulation Diagnosis framework (**AMD**) for the MDSM problem that synergizes artifact pre-perception encoding and manipulation-oriented reasoning to effectively adapt MLLMs for precise manipulation analysis is proposed.



## Setup

```shell
conda create -n AMD python=3.10
conda activate AMD
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you encounter issues with flash-attn, you can fix it with the following command:

```shell
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Alternatively, you can visit the [flash-attention releases page](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases) to find the version compatible with your environment and follow the installation instructions provided there.

## Data

Our MDSM dataset is coming soon. And the DGM4 dataset is avaliable at [DGM4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/rshaojimmy/DGM4)


You can also prepare your training or inference data like:

```

    image2.png
test.json:
[
    {
        "id": 1556711,

        "fake_cls": "orig",
        "fake_image_box": [],
        "mtcnn_boxes": [
            [

                145,
                159
        ],
        "mtcnn_boxes": [
            [
                64,
                48,
                145,
                159
            ],
            [

                285
            ]
        ]
    },
]
```


## Inference

Please run:
```shell
sh test.sh
```

## Training
Please run:

```shell
# Original training (with bbox supervision)
sh train.sh

# Training without bbox supervision signal
sh train_no_bbox.sh
```
Please fill the MODEL_PATH, TRAIN_JS, and VAL_JS with your real checkpoint path and data path.
